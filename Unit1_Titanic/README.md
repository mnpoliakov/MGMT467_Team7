# MGMT467_Team7 – Unit 1: Titanic Insights Project

Welcome to our team repository for **Unit 1: Titanic Analysis**.  
This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to uncover insights about survival patterns, demographics, and other data-driven findings. Each team member conducted their own independent analysis and later collaborated to produce a collective executive summary and visualization dashboard.

### Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Perform **individual exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
- Summarize personal findings and interpretations in a Markdown report.
- Combine key insights into a **team-wide Executive Brief** supported by a **Looker Studio visualization**.
- Maintain clear and transparent documentation of the analytical process using prompt logs.

### Individual Analysis

Each team member:
1. Worked independently within their respective `/individual/[name]/` folder.  
2. Used a Python notebook to analyze the Titanic dataset.  
3. Produced a short **Markdown summary file (`summary.md`)** outlining:
   - Key insights and visualizations  
   - Variables influencing survival  
   - Reflections on analytical approach  

This ensures each member contributed unique perspectives before synthesizing findings as a group.
