1. Undergo data cleaning and preprocessing steps. Remove the entire cabin column,  and create a predictive model (Random Forrest) from the variables to predict the missing age. Go through this process step by step and give tips for refinement. 

2. Generate useful summary statistics and relevant distributions that enhance the analysis. Go through this process step by step and include tips on things to look at further to make the analysis better. For numerical variables do not include passenger ID and only look at gender and embarked for categorical variables  
     
3. Identify the potential predictors of survival, specifically looking at age and gender and other factors in the correlation matrix that had higher or lower correlation with survival. Go through a step by step process and give tips at each step on possible refinements.
