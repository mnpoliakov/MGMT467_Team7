# Individual Contribution Report

**Role:** Data Engineer & System Architect
**Project Focus:** Real-time Weather Data Streaming Pipeline

---

## 💡 Executive Summary
My primary contribution to this project was the end-to-end design and implementation of the data streaming infrastructure. I served as the lead architect, responsible for ingesting live meteorological data from the **Weatherstack API** and ensuring its reliable delivery for analysis. Additionally, I developed the governing operational documentation, created the visual architectural blueprints, and conducted a distinct **DIVE analysis** to extract actionable insights from the dataset.

## 1. ⚙️ Streaming Pipeline Architecture & Development

I engineered the core technical backbone of the project, focusing on the seamless ingestion and processing of data.

* **API Integration:** I developed the extraction logic to interface with the **Weatherstack API**, configuring the system to handle real-time requests and manage rate limits effectively.
* **Pipeline Construction:** I built the complete streaming pipeline architecture, designing the data flow from the source API through to the storage layer, ensuring both low latency and high availability.
* **Data Integrity:** I implemented robust error handling and data validation steps within the pipeline to ensure that only clean, structured data was passed downstream for analysis.

## 2. 📝 Documentation & Operational Governance

To ensure the project's longevity and reproducibility, I produced the key technical documentation deliverables:

* **Architecture Diagram:** I designed the official high-level architecture diagram. This visual artifact mapped the data lineage, system dependencies, and cloud resources, providing a clear **"blueprint"** of the system topology.
* **Operational Controls Document:** I authored the operational controls documentation. This document outlined crucial governance protocols, including API key security, cost monitoring alerts, data retention policies, and failure recovery procedures.

## 3. 📊 Analytical Contribution (DIVE Analysis)

Beyond the technical engineering, I performed an individual **DIVE Analysis** to interpret the collected data and generate business intelligence.

* **Methodology:** I applied the DIVE framework to the weather dataset, isolating specific variables to uncover high impact weather events.
* **Actionable Insights:** This analysis bridged the gap between raw data collection and strategic insight.

## 4. 🎤 Project Presentation

I contributed directly to the final deliverables and stakeholder communication effort:

* **Slide Development:** I built **two key slides** for the final presentation deck. These slides specifically translated the complex technical architecture and my analytical findings into accessible visuals and clear summaries for a non-technical audience.
